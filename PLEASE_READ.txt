** PLEASE READ **
For some reason, the deployed version of the app on heroku has an H12 timeout error when
trying to access the stats. I documented the error on piazza like so:

My app fetches data from a python package api. This data is fetched on a page load which
takes very little time on local but for some reason I get an H12 error on Heroku every
time I try to go beyond the home page in the deployed version. This is strange to me because
the data I'm fetching is not large, at least not enough to warrant a >30 second response
time, so I'm really confused on why this is happening as these pages load super quick on
local even though the api call response time shouldn't vary that much.
 
The app builds and deploys just fine. Here are the Heroku logs:

2024-12-09T05:42:20.570374+00:00 heroku[router]: at=error code=H12 desc="Request timeout"
method=GET path="/nba_stats/player/1628973/" host=mini-fb-3c30967d650d.herokuapp.com

My only explanation is that it's something weird with the NBA api I'm using. I've never faced
this issue with the classes' previous assignments or with other django apps I've built that
fetch api data.

I cannot pre-download the data like the professor reccomened because the purpose of the app
is to have the stats of every nba player from 1950 - present. But the app does not function by
fetching all of that data at once (way too large), it fetches the data for a specific player when the user requests
it (so it's weird that it's timing out). If you would like to try the app out, please run it locally. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
You can also check the video as it shows the app in action.
